    <h1>How to Play</h1>
    <p>While riding in a car, look for cars of different colors. Call out the car and color so that other players don't claim it. Different colors are different points and each "rainbow" (complete set of colors) is additional bonus points. The person with the most points at the end of the trip wins.</p>
