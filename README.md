# Rainbow Road Trip
A game inspired by one my kids made up. The basics of the game is that while you are in the car, you try to see how many 'car rainbows' you can make by counting the cars of different colors. This app is designed to help them keep track of the different colors as they go and add a scoring system to it to make it a little more interesting. 

The site can be used completely offline and saves the game in the browser so that you can use it for long road trips and not have to worry about having internet connection or losing progress.
